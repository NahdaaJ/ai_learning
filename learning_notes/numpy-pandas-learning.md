# NumPy Arrays

**NumPy arrays** are fixed-size containers of items that are more efficient thatn Python lists or tuples for data processing.

- They only store a single data type.
- They can be one dimensional or multi-dimensional.
- Array elements can be modified, but the array size cannot change.

## Properties

- `ndim` → number of dimensions in array
- `shape` → size of array for each dimension
- `size` → total number of elements in array
- `dtype` → data type of elements in array
