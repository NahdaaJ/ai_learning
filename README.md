# AI Learning ðŸŒ¸

Welcome to my AI Learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my path towards becoming an AI Engineer. Here, you'll find a collection of coding exercises, projects, and notes that I've accumulated throughout my learning process.

## Contents of the Repo ðŸŒ·
In the [`notes`](learning_notes/) directory, you will find notes I've written on the coding aspect of my learning!
Here, you will find notes on:

### Mathematics
- [`Linear Algebra`](learning_notes/linear_algebra.md)

### Coding
- [`Numpy and Pandas`](learning_notes/numpy-pandas-learning.md)

You will be able to find the associated coding exercises in the similarly named directories!
