## Contents of the Repo ðŸŒ·
The repo is structured into the different topics and sections of my roadmap. Within each topic, youâ€™ll find associated notes, practice code and perhaps even mini projects.

- [`01-python-basics`](01-python-basics/) - This contains all the Python Basics content.
  - [`notes`](01-python-basics/notes/) - Notes from each section of my Python Basics Learning.
  - [`practice-code`](01-python-basics/practice-code/) - Files of practice code to practice what I learnt.
## Goals ðŸŒ·

My primary goal is to become proficient in AI and machine learning, with a focus on:

- Understanding the theoretical and mathematical theory behind ML and AI.
- Gaining practical experience in implementing these algorithms.
- Applying AI to solve complex, real-world problems.
